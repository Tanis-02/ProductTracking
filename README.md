# Project Title
This project is designed to track the production of audio, visual and combination products.
It was made for my Object-Oriented Programming class, created independently but with guided instrutions
and help from Professors, TAs, and other classmates. At the time of the creation of this project
I was a novice with Java but as the semester went along, I learned more complicated Java concepts.
